        <p>The tasks of the IT technician are very diverse, depending on the job they hold. The fact that he is 
            trained in the computer’s installation, start-up and maintenance makes him/her indispensable in 
            almost all areas of working life.
            Depending on the case, the IT technician is therefore found in computer sales sector (customer 
            advice), in companies that have a computer park (maintenance of workstations, computer 
            networks, mainframe computers), in companies that sell software or computer services, in research 
            and development, etc.
            In addition to the work described, the IT technician also takes care of simple programming work. 
            He/She is nevertheless more a technician than a programmer</p>
